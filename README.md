# excel2robot

In summary, this script converts an excel file to a robot framework text file.

I've made this because I wanted to maintain a robot test file with json test cases and I didn't want to save them externally.
To see this working save an excel file with Sheets named *Settings*, *Variables*, *Test Cases* and *Keywords* (case sensitive!!!)

**python convert_to_robot.py excelfile.xlsx testfile.robot**
